## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of [Generative Multi-Label Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11606.pdf).
> In this work, we tackle the problem of synthesizing multi-label features in the context of zero-shot setting for recognition all (un)seen labels with a novel training mechanism.

## Installation
The codebase is built on PyTorch 1.1.0 and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 environment (Python3.6, CUDA9.0, cuDNN7.5).

For installing, follow these intructions
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mlzsl
```

## Data Preparation

Please download NUS-WIDE train and test(unseen and seen-unseen) features into `./data` folder according to the instructions within the folder.

## Training and Evaluation

### NUS-WIDE

To train and evaluate zero-shot learning model on full NUS-WIDE dataset, please run:
```
sh scripts/train_nus_wide.sh or ./scripts/train_nus_wide.sh

```
## Model Checkpoint

We also include the checkpoint of the zero-shot generative model on NUS-WIDE for fast evaluation in `weights` folder. Please download the pretrained weights according to the intructions within the folder. To reproduce results, please run:
```
sh scripts/eval_nus_wide.sh or ./scripts/eval_nus_wide.sh

```
